    <h1>Your Internet connection is <em>not encrypted</em>.</h1>
    <p>
    That means pretty much anyone on the network with the right tools can see what you're doing right now.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    BUT the <a href="http://cafe.slow/about">Slow Internet Café</a> works by looking at and changing the contents of the web sites you view. Encryption prevents that. Normally that's a good thing. Except now your encryption is getting in the way of our fun!
    </p>
    <p>
    If you want to fully enjoy the Café and you do trust us, please let your web browser know by clicking below to download a <a href="slow-internet-cafe-ca-cert.pem" class="certificate">security certificate</a>. This certificate isn't a computer program; it's more like a secret handshake or a friendship bracelet and just lets your computer know that we're buddies. It also lets us re-encrypt your connection again before it goes across the wild Internet, so we'll be the only ones with this special access.

    *** To be honest, this is pretty much the same trick as one that the United States' NSA uses to spy on Internet users around the world. The difference is that they do it without telling anyone while we want to get your <em>consent</em> before doing this, and we're not interested in using your data against you or selling it to advertisers. But to be clear: we will be able to see everything you read and write as long as you're connected to our network. We will totally invade your privacy, but only if you want us to.

    When it comes down to it, the whole Internet works on trust. A lot of times that trust is broken. Many times you don't even know who you're trusting, really. You just send out your pics and tweets and bank account and whatever and hope it gets safely to the other side and back without any funny business happening in between. For the most part, trusting strangers just seems to work. But at the Slow Internet Cafe you can come talk to us in person or <a href="mailto:director@slowerinternet.com">send us an e-mail</a> if you have questions about our intentions. Is this any better than what the other guys have to offer? That's for you to decide.
